This is the final release of [export-hook-1.1.0][export-hook].

These release notes provide a summary of changes since export-hook 1.0.2.

+ Added an @export annotation for (re)export of individually annotated instances.

+ Added support for @imports directly on a type class companion, avoiding the need for redundant low priority traits
  in simple cases.

+ Added [MiMa][mima] to the build.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed ideas, enthusiasm and encouragement.
